        <p>it is spontaneous. it is a clothing crisis, femmephobia, i deleted but came back later. i am hot on top of my blanket, i am sitting on a blanket which is standing in my room, which is… ah i just remember this story that said ‘please don’t correct my english. i have no respect for this language’ and like the plants just keep growing and i tell them but the light is gonna diminish i hope you know, there’s no more space here, please stop growing, let’s just enjoy or grow inwards like the new hipster <a class="BS" href="./index.html"><strong id="BS">bullshit.</strong></a> i somehow still want my body to grow, it is tiny and it is ok, but i’m a rectangle. and it’s not nice to be a geometrical basic form, i think anyone would agree on that, people even go as far as to use ‘cute as a triangle can be’ and then i think let’s make a movie and forget about all the, i don’t know, ‘the poetics of innocence’ because many times lyricism is connected to a sort of non-visceral way of being and moving and i think for a very long time i got attached to this idea: the angel-flower-misfit-monk-silent-crap-theory-failure-is-also-beautiful and no, i mean, we don’t get to fucking fail or at least in the way we know failure to be. a kinky flower clothespin, things i like: pastel purple or green venetian blinds, aerated queues.

                there is something about us. the movement, fingers around crackly but alive weeds. the ground dirt the language still forever foreign we write to absolve us from memory. the group broadens expands through its borders and the volume gets louder every time. most of the uncovered bodies dictate portray standard masculine features or desires which show this people share the same chemistry, anyway it’s you not them i wanted to release it was about our tiny genitals that find each other in some kind of siblingship. the grinding. the leafs hanging from the sky with its blue backdrop. it’s my tiny everything in my body, all of the visible takes little to no space and it’s by resisting to get dressed that i tell you it’s ok the weeds are still here they are unkillable and you’re gonna archive all of this lives that would in turn remain hidden and ultimately dead. the burning heat makes me question whether it is water or sweat whether it is anxiety to be seen or anxiety to remain alone. it’s the repetition, i don’t mind the repetition. as the phone cools down i get back to typing. i wonder what is everyone doing in their phones. i wonder what is everybody saying, eating, what really is the taste of their sweat and since C said i must attract a lot of people i wonder if everyone is secretly crushing on me or my birth chart is wrong. i wonder if i make it hard for them. for some reason whenever i talk to most acquaintances they seem extremely nervous, is it them wanting to exit the situation or are they ultimately crushed out on me ahaha. weeds growing pasta slurps and schnucks. today it sunned all day i wonder where do all the smiles go to, how they get lost in the space between us never reaching, it’s the non-touching era. i can’t with the half hugs, my ass flaps kissing each other and middle aged screams, hungry stream and packs of torrents. water will always be the common denominator, i see why the desert, a life detach.
