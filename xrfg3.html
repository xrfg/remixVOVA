          heat and demonstration, fire and sanitisation, we gather all the
          objects on the table and put them onto our backs. the dirt
          accumulating beneath our nails i could never rely on my clothes to
          tell stories i could never rely on people to hear the silence. the sky
          announces: dry and crackly. all the water in my body makes for the
          moisture still remnant, i feel so detached from this reality there’s a
          chance to start building, the flee to the city, wild animals search
          for metallic parts on the floor, empty salted peanuts packs and the so
          called cigarette butts. there is something about cake, they have an
          anal quality, i wish i could show you i wish you would have seen,
          there is something about anal positivity, there is something about the
          music i hear from a distance, how i never participate how i see you in
          safe-diference. your shirt says 'spirit' the other 'bitch relax', i
          know you don’t get it, i still don’t know whether i want you to get
          it. across the park you wave and i remember we could talk about our
          non binaries, how i maybe just wanted to talk about something else.
          how the words permeate my brain less and less, getting dyslexic at 24,
          forgetting, closer to, closer to, closer... to the so called listener.
          i am air i am evasion and theft i am mute silky stone arms closed no
          sweat just an oversized prepartum t-shirt, i am a strong body hidden
          on small bones, size has never meant strength, a blue sky living under
          soft conditions i could pray to nature but i think they have done
          enough for us, this world is... collective isolation also empathy
          alienation a general confusion but no concussion. it may be called
          however you like it, things are always changing. i know nothing i told
          you, it’s easier this way, has to do with fun, domestic animals rub on
          dead matter as in everything continues.

            hope no one is calling me 'that guy’, i fold my lower legs under its
            upper counterparts my peri-anal opening free</span
